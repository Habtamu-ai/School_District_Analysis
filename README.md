## Second, we created the following metrics;
   #### The district summary
   #### The school summary
   #### The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
   #### The average math score for each grade level from each school
   #### The average reading score for each grade level from each school
   #### The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type 
   
   
   #### The district summary
   Looking at the two figures below the first district summary and the district summary after we replaced the grade 9th Thomas High school, there is a change in the math, reading and overall percentage passing rate though it is minimal.
